# Long Description

## Background

It is July, and COVID-19 is still affecting our lives and livelihood, with no surety of stopping anytime soon. As we wait for its vaccine to be developed, socializing responsibility is seemingly one of our best options. These are precautionary measures like social-distancing, regular handwashing, and avoiding gatherings in our daily life. But what about businesses? Companies lost their customers amid the COVID-19 crisis. Essential-businesses are working hardly only with a thin line of defense against COVID-19. After the extended restrictions, non-essential businesses are also opening even though the current COVID-19 measures are not fail-safe. Uncertainty and risks would be higher in after-lockdown. It is impracticable for people to go back to their before-COVID-19 lifestyle.

What saves unsafe and unpredictable businesses? What makes people go back to retails and restaurants without fear? One of the things causing the current devastating situation is an INVISIBLE COVID-19 infection risk. When, Where, What, and Who is high-risk? That's everyone's question. Our team created COVSAFE that is an application to enable companies and customers to see real-time threats and maintain an all-day-everyday low COVID-19 risk environment.
 
## Our Solution: COVSAFE

COVSAFE generates a risk score named ANSHIN-index, a Japanese word for safety, for each employee and business activity. When ANSHIN-index exhibits a high COVID-risk scenario, COVSAFE notifies managers and staff in concise and attractive visual notification formats. It helps the team stay clean and maintain a healthy work-life. As well, through color-based and advertisement-based notice, COVSAFE influences customers' behaviors, which is like indirect suggestions to make people willing to avoid the risks.

COVSAFE components are:

1. Gathering raw-sensing data to detect people's activity, like people to people interactions (area congestions and area-wise social distance), common area activities (handwashing and garbage cleaning), and staff operations (store operations and sanitization practices)

2. Real-time ANSHIN-index calculation to compare to pre-set recommended safety values about the individual staff risk, the store area risk in terms of sanitization, disinfection, and congestion

3. Proactive risk prevention suggestions based on ANSHIN-index

4. Risk visualization to staff through color-based notice, to customers through advertisement-based advice that positively influences the behavior based on nudge theory, and to managers through a web-based app that shows a live-risk heatmap of the facility
 
## Uniqueness:

Current solutions mainly focus on social distancing. Bluetooth-based solution by Google and Apple predicts the risk while maintaining user privacy. SecureXtect is a solution similar to COVSAFE and visualizes COVID-19 risk. It still focuses on humans' body temperatures and stores congestion. COVSAFE concept is "all covered with healthy, sanitizing, disinfecting, and social distancing willingly." It comprehensively targets staff+customers+operations+area together and visualizes the calculated risks through attractive ways, making it unique among other solutions.

On conclusion, the points making COVSAFE unique are: 

- Personalized and Area-specific risk visualization about social distance, sanitizing, and disinfection

- Field-work support system by proactive prevention suggestions

- Color-based and Advertisement-based risk notification that let people willing to avoid the risks
